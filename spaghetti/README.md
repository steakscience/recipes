Ingredients:
- pasta, ideally spaghetti
- olive oil
- chilli flakes
- bacon cubes (or chopped up bacon)
- some kind of protein, ie. small pieces of chicken cubes
- garlic
- thyme


Basically the goal is to have everything finished, then you want to add pasta and mix it.

### Pasta
- boil and cook according to package instructions
- when draining, make sure to reserve some of the “pasta water”

### The main stuff
1. add olive oil, low heat
2. Add bacon cubes, other protein, salt
3. When they are almost brown, add garlic (you add garlic late to avoid burning)
4. Then add chili fakes, add salt, taste, etc. You may want to add a little bit of sugar. This rounds things out.
5. At this point, it should taste saltier than you need. This is fine.
6. When things are good, turn off the heat, add thyme. Mix for 10 sec.
7. Then add cooked pasta, add some pasta water, and mix thoroughly
8. Should be done, add extra pepper and salt as necessary
